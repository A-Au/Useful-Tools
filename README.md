List of useful/interesting tools that I've come across 

## Tools for exposing local servers

* [Serveo](serveo.net) - free, no need to install anything, doesn't appear to have a limit on the number of connections, preservation of URL
* [ngrok](ngrok.com) - has a free tier but limited to only 40 connections/minute, different URL each time you run it
